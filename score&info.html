                <p>The Binary Counting system is set up in the base2 system. The base10 system is the most well known, going from 0-9 before repeating the pattern. Binary, however, only uses 0's and 1's. 
                    <br />
                    When counting in base 10, you start with a single decimal place. Upon reaching 9, a new decimal place must be created, the tens place, representing 10<sup>1</sup>. When both places are filled again, another place is created, representing 10<sup>2</sup>. 
                    <br />
                    When counting in base 2, the same decimal place pattern is used. However, since we only have 0-1 to work with, the decimal places increase in powers of 2. As such, we have the 1s place (2<sup>0</sup>), the 2s place (2<sup>1</sup>), the 4s place (2<sup>2</sup>), and so on,counting up in the powers of 2.
                    This image below shows how you would express the number 55 in both base10 and in base2
                </p>
                <img src="base10.png" class="responsive-img" /> <br /><img src="base2.png" class="responsive-img" />
                <p>
                    In base10, 55 is expressed simply as five 1's, and five 10's, and 0 of the other places. in Base2, however, 55 is expressed as one 1, one 2, one 4, zero 8's, one 16, and one 32.
                    <br /> <br />
                    For the purposes of the game, we won't use more than the 128's place. An easy way to determine a binary conversion is to count down the places. For example, using 55 again, I won't use 64 or anything bigger, so I know that I have a 32. 55 - 32 is 23. 16 is the next place, so I will use a 16. 23 - 16 is 7. 
                    Because 7 is less than 8, I won't use the 8's place, so I drop down to the 4. 7 - 4 is 3. I will use the 2's next, leaving me with a 1, which I will use the 1's place for. <br> This leaves us with 55 = 110111
