## HTML

html is building a tree (DOM - document object model - describes the structure of the tree)

pay attention to broad tags (header, main, nav, body, footer, etc)

`<a href a="address">link name<\a>` to create links

`<title>` determines what is desplayed on the tab lable on the browser bar 

`<hr \>` adds a dividing line to the page in the abscence of css. Note that because it is self contained, you don't need a closing tag

class : identifier for css or java that multiple objects can  (broad)

id : identifier for css or java that only a single object may have (specific)

pay attention to how simon-html sets up for elements that will be edited later with code, like player name on play.html

## CSS

'*'{} -  this is a universal styling guide that can be overridden (ignore the '')
